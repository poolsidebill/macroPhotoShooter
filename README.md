# macroPhotoShooter
Control Canon R5 camera via Canon's CCAPI RESTful interface and a 3D Printer bed via GCode/MCode to create multiple images for macrophotograghy. The printer bed acts as a slide for the subject while the camera stays still. The program determines the Depth Of Field based on user input, then controls the bed's movement between camera captures.
